The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal,
the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name
refers to its camel-like appearance and the patches of color on its fur. Its
chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its
horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under
the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The
nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.

The giraffe's scattered range extends:

* Chad in the north
* South Africa in the south
* Niger in the west 
* Somalia in the east. 

Giraffes usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their primary
food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores
cannot reach. Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by
leopards, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong
social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be
moving in the same general direction. 

>>> Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. 

Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for
raising the young.

The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its
peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and
cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
as Least Concern, but has been extirpated from many parts of its former range,
and some subspecies are classified as Endangered. Nevertheless, giraffes are
still found in numerous national parks and game reserves.
