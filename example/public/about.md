The Lanyon Zoo is a test site for the [Lanyon markdown web
server](https://github.com/mkaz/lanyon). It demos the features and abilities of
the server with grace and humility. 

The theme is loosely based off the [Sorbet
theme](http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/sorbet/) by Automattic. It was
simplified and made a bit lighter by removing the icon font. All content on the
demo site is from Wikipedia.

Lanyon was created by Marcus Kazmierczak, [@mkaz](http://twitter.com/mkaz) and is used to
publish his personal site [mkaz.com](http://mkaz.com/)
