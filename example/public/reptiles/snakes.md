Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes
that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and
external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates
covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with many more
joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger
than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow
bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other
instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species
retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the
cloaca.

Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, in the Pacific and
Indian Oceans, and on most smaller land masses â€” exceptions include some large
islands, such as Ireland and New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic
and central Pacific.

```python

class Point:
    """ Create a new Point, at coordinates x, y """

    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        """ Create a new point at x, y """
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def distance_from_origin(self):
        """ Compute my distance from the origin """
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

```


Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing
or aquatic lizards during the mid-Cretaceous period, and the earliest known
fossils date to around 112 Ma ago. The diversity of modern snakes appeared
during the Paleocene period (c 66 to 56 Ma ago). The oldest preserved
descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.

Most species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill
and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough
to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow
prey alive or kill by constriction.
