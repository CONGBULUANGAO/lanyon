Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with approximately 6,000
species,[1] ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most
oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder
Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with
overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes â€“
they form an evolutionary grade.[2] While the snakes are recognized as falling
phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the
sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic
group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.

Lizards typically have feet and external ears, while snakes lack both of these
characteristics. However, because they are defined negatively as excluding
snakes, lizards have no unique distinguishing characteristic as a group. Lizards
and snakes share a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the
sphenodonts, which have more primitive and solid diapsid skulls. Many lizards
can detach their tails to escape from predators, an act called autotomy. Vision,
including color vision, is particularly well developed in most lizards, and most
communicate with body language or bright colors on their bodies, as well as with
pheromones. Lizards are the most speciose among extant reptiles, comprising
about 60% of all living species.

The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters
for chameleons such as Brookesia micra and geckos such as Sphaerodactylus
ariasae to nearly 3 m (9.8 ft) in the case of the largest living varanid
lizard, the Komodo dragon. Some extinct varanids reached great size. The
extinct aquatic mosasaurs reached 17 m (56 ft), and the giant monitor
Megalania is estimated to have reached up to 7 m (23 ft) long.
