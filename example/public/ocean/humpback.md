The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale. One of
the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from 12–16 metres (39–52 ft)
and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 lb). The humpback has a
distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. An
acrobatic animal known for breaching and slapping the water with its tail and
pectorals, it is popular with whale watchers off Australia, New Zealand, South
America, Canada, and the United States. Males produce a complex song lasting 10
to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear,
though it may have a role in mating.

Found in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up
to 25,000 kilometres (16,000 mi) each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in
polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give
birth in the winter. During the winter, humpbacks fast and live off their fat
reserves. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Humpbacks have a
diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net feeding
technique.

Like other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the whaling
industry. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population fell by an
estimated 90% before a moratorium was introduced in 1966. While stocks have
since partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships,
and noise pollution continue to impact the 80,000 humpbacks worldwide.
